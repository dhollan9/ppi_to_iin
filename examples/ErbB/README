To run code, set parms_iin.inp to desired parameters.

./mc_iin_opt.exe parms_iin.inp ErbB_Pro_Names.inp ErbB_Edges_new.txt ErbB_IIN_Reduced_new.txt

The last argument is not necessary if you use flagsplit=0 or flagsplit=1.

The parameters do the following

****PPIN parameters****

npro: Number of proteins in the network
nedge: Number of protein-protein interactions in the network

****Fitness function parameters****

gamma: (Called "beta" in outputs) Penalizes high clustering (triangles)
alpha: (Called "ksi" or "kappa" in outputs) Penalizes unclosed chains
mu: Penalizes a high number of interfaces, either on individual proteins or absolute number in the system depending on the fitness function used
omega: Penalizes extra edges, ie more than one binding mode between a pair of proteins
zeta: Only used for fitnessflag=2. Zeta penalizes self-looped nodes with other connections
MCTemp: The "temperature" for the Boltzmann probability distribution, kBT. A high MCTemp makes suboptimal moves more likely to be accepted

****flagsplit****

0: Initializes from the "dense" initial state, where each protein has one interface
1: Initializes from the "sparse" initial state, where each edge has a separate interface on each protein.

2: Initializes from a manually defined network (the fourth input)

****PAEflag****

0: Calculates the PAE by stochastically generating networks to compare the IIN degree distribution to each iteration. This process is very slow

1: Reads in a file ("PMFfile.txt") containing degree distributions for different network sizes and densities and different PAEs. Compares to the IIN to find the best fit PAE.

2: Calculates the index of dispersion (variance/mean) of the degree distribution instead of the PAE

****fitnessflag****

0: Penalizes a high number of interfaces per protein

1: Penalizes the absolute number of interfaces in the network

2: Penalzies the absolute number of interfaces in the network, and any self-looped nodes with high degree

****Other****

The other parameters are for older versions of the code and do not need to be changed.
