***Compiling***

If you have all the prerequisites, you only need to use the command

  make

to compile the program.

***Prerequisites***

You will need a C/C++ compiler, such as g++. This code requires the following libraries

This code requires the following libraries:

Linux systems:
libgsl
libgfortran
libm
libblas
libstdc++

libblas may be replaced with libg2c if you do not have it, but you must change the Makefile (change all instances of -lblas to -lg2c)

Mac systems:
libgsl
libgfortran
libm
libquadmath
libstdc++

If you have a library installed but the Makefile cannot find it, try adding the library path to the LIBS variable. An example path is
-L/usr/local/lib
The Makefile will search this folder for any relevant libraries.
